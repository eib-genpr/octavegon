# Octavegon 8-Bit Music Generator

**Note:** This project is a work in progress (WIP).

Octavegon is an 8-bit music generator that combines C++ for audio synthesis and Haskell for music composition. It is designed to evoke nostalgia with its 8-bit tunes reminiscent of retro video game music.

## Technologies Used
- C++ for Audio Generation (//TODO)
- Haskell for Music Theory and Composition (//TODO)
- Java and Spring Boot for a User-Friendly CLI (//TODO)

## Project Goals
- Generate 8-bit style melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.
- Allow users to customize music generation parameters.

### Trained Model for Transcription (WIP)

The project now includes a transcription feature that allows you to transcribe notes from audio segments. A trained model accurately identifies notes played in the provided audio.


**Note:** Trained model and generated dataset is not included is here as they have huge sizes now
