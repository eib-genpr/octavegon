# Octavegon 8-Bit Music Generator

This project is an 8-bit music generator that uses C++ for audio synthesis and Haskell for music composition. It aims to create nostalgic 8-bit tunes reminiscent of retro video game music.

## Technologies Used

- C++ for audio generation
- Haskell for music theory and composition
- Java and Spring Boot for a user-friendly CLI (optional)

## Project Goals

- Generate 8-bit style melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.
- Allow users to customize music generation parameters.
